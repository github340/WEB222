                A Responsive Design is a technique that automatically changes the size of a screen depending on the type of display on a website.

                • How does responsive design relate to web technologies?
            </p>
            <p class="answer">
                A Responsive Design is a web development approach that dynamically changes the appearance of a website depending on the screen size and orientation of the device used to view it. A Reponsive Design rely on proportion-based grids to rearrange content and design elements.

                • What did you learn about building web apps for different devices through your research?
            </p>
            <p class="answer">
                The first thing to consider in building a responsive website is layout. When building a responsive website, it always begins by creating a non-responsive layout that is fixed to the basic size. If developers have created a non-responsive layout, create a responsive site by adding some changes to the media query and CSS. Media query consists of determining the type of media and the conditions of specific media functions. Media query allows users to adjust the size to fit a specific range of output devices without changing the content itself. In other words, media query gives users a great view of the website on all kinds of displays, from smartphones to large screens.
                
                Typography is also important. Until recently, most developers used pixels to define font sizes. If the width of the website is fixed, pixels are easy to use, but responsive websites must have responsive fonts. The site font size must be related to the container width, so it can be adapted to the client screen and easily read from the mobile device.

                • Finally, describe your learning experience in the course.
            </p>
            <p class="answer">
                I cannot believe that the second semester is already over at the end of this semester. If the course or assignment was not fun with an honest mind, I would have thought about when this semester would end and why time would not pass. The first web I learned was a new experience for me and I was happy to see myself developing every time I did all the assignments. Also, it was good to now some responsive web design this semester. A responsive web design is to automatically resize a websize using HTML and CSS. Responsive web design makes web design look great on all devices. It is no longer enough not to have a static website design that is good to see only on a PC screen, as access to the Internet is now available on mobile devices.

                While taking the WEB222 course, I seriously thought about my job as a web designer. It was good that I can check the code I wrote with my eyes through HTML and CSS. I want to be a web designer who makes a really good website. Other parts are fine, but JavaScript is still a difficult part for me. I learned many things such as appendChild, querySelector, createElement, and so on, but there are still things I do not understand. If I do not understand these things, I will not be a good web designer, so I will try harder in the future.

                Lastly, professor, I would like to conclude the final assignment of the web222 course by saying that it was an honor to be able to attend your lecture.
